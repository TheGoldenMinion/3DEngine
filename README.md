# 3DEngine
A 3D engine (raycaster; close enough) written in JavaScript.
It started out as an engine, but right now I'm trying to build into a game where you deliver chicken nuggets. 

FUTURE ME:
yea that never happened. life doesnt work like that lol. the most basic code isnt working and i'm pulling out my hair.
